I am a health economist working at Newcastle University. I am currently completing an MSc in Public Health at Newcastle University after graduating with a BSc in Economics from Newcastle University in 2019. My research involves both within-trial and model-based economic evaluations for health-technology assessments. I have recently built an economic model estimating the cost-effectiveness of methenamine hippurate (an oral antiseptic) relative to antibiotic prophylaxis. Aside from health economics, I am particularly interested in the applications of programming and data science for research. I am currently developing a web-scraping algorithm designed to clean and cost patient reported concomitant medications.
